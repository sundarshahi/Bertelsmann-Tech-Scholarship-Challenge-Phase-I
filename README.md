# Bertelsmann-Tech-Scholarship-Challenge-Phase-I

It's been my pleasure and honor to be one of the Udacity Bertelsmann Scholarship Recipient - Artificial Intelligence (A.I) Track. Thus, this repository is dedicated to my study in the Phase 1(The Challenge Course) and Phase 2(Deep Learning Nanodegree) which I am claiming to get.
